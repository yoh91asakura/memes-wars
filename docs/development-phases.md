## Cross-Phase Requirements

### Documentation Consistency
- All phase documents must be synchronized
- CLAUDE.md updated with current phase status
- Agent contexts updated across all AI tools
- Version control with proper commit messages

### Quality Assurance
- Code review required for all changes
- Automated testing runs on all commits
- Performance benchmarks validated continuously
- Security scans performed at each phase transition

### Communication Protocols
- Phase transition notifications to all stakeholders
- Status updates in project documentation
- Risk escalation procedures for blocked progress
- Regular sync meetings for complex features

### AI Agent Coordination
- Context synchronization across Claude, Copilot, and other AI tools
- Shared understanding of current phase and objectives
- Consistent file navigation and project structure
- Token optimization for efficient AI interactions

## Emergency Procedures

### Phase Rollback
**Trigger**: Critical issues preventing phase progression
**Action**: Return to previous phase, reassess requirements
**Recovery**: Address blocking issues, re-validate exit criteria

### Fast-Track Approval
**Trigger**: Urgent business requirements or critical bugs
**Action**: Expedited review process with mandatory checkpoints
**Safeguards**: Minimum quality gates must still be met

### Cross-Team Dependencies
**Trigger**: External dependencies blocking progress
**Action**: Alternative approach planning or timeline adjustment
**Communication**: Immediate stakeholder notification and replanning

---

## Metrics and KPIs

### Phase Transition Metrics
- **Time in Phase**: Average duration per phase type
- **Rework Rate**: Percentage of phases requiring rollback
- **Quality Score**: Aggregated quality gate performance
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Feedback scores per phase

### Success Indicators
- **On-Time Delivery**: Phases completed within estimated time
- **Quality Metrics**: Tests passing, coverage, performance benchmarks
- **Technical Debt**: Code quality metrics and maintainability scores
- **User Impact**: Feature adoption and user satisfaction scores
