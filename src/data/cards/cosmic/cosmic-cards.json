Every universe that has ever existed, every possibility that has ever been imagined, every dream that has ever been dreamed—all flow through the Eternal Nexus. It is the source code of reality, the fundamental force that gives meaning to existence itself. When gods speak of higher powers, they whisper its name. When reality fractures, it holds the pieces together. When infinity needs to be contained, it provides the vessel. The Nexus is not just a being—it is being itself, the eternal question that creates all answers, the infinite story that tells itself into existence.",
