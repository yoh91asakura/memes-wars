# Overview
Memes Wars is a modern card collection and battle game that combines the viral nature of internet memes with strategic card gameplay. Players collect unique emoji-based cards, build decks, and engage in tactical battles. The project features a clean atomic design architecture, real-time multiplayer capabilities, and a comprehensive rolling system with pity mechanics.

# Core Features
- **Card Collection System**: Players can roll for cards with different rarities (common to cosmic)
- **Atomic Design UI**: Clean, modular component architecture for maintainable frontend
- **Rolling System**: Sophisticated pity system ensuring fair card distribution
- **Card Battles**: Strategic turn-based combat system
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Live battles between players
- **Deck Building**: Strategic deck construction with card synergies
- **Emoji-based Cards**: Unique card system based on popular emojis and memes
- **Progressive Rewards**: Achievement system and seasonal rewards

# User Experience
- **Primary Users**: Gamers aged 16-35 who enjoy card games and internet culture
- **Key Flows**: 
  - Onboarding → Rolling cards → Building decks → Battle other players
  - Collection management and card upgrades
- **UI/UX**: Mobile-first responsive design with smooth animations and intuitive controls

- Card collection tracking and statistics
- Inventory management system

## Phase 3: Game Mechanics
- Battle system implementation
- Deck building interface
- Card synergies and effects system
- Game rules engine
- Turn-based combat logic

## Phase 4: User Management
- User authentication and profiles
- Friends system and social features
- User preferences and settings
- Achievement system
- Leaderboards and rankings

## Phase 5: Multiplayer Features
- Real-time battle matching
- Spectator mode
- Chat system during battles
- Tournament and events system
- Seasonal content updates

## Phase 6: Polish and Optimization
- Performance optimizations
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Accessibility enhancements
- Security hardening
- Analytics and monitoring

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation First**: Atomic design components → Card system → Rolling mechanics
2. **Visible Progress**: Frontend card display → Interactive rolling → Collection view
3. **Core Gameplay**: Battle system → Deck building → Multiplayer matching
4. **User Features**: Authentication → Social features → Tournaments
5. **Polish**: Performance → Mobile optimization → Production deployment

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Technical Debt**: Maintain atomic design principles, regular refactoring
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication, input validation, rate limiting
- **User Retention**: Focus on engaging gameplay loops and progression systems
- **Performance**: Optimize bundle size, implement lazy loading, efficient state management

# Appendix
- Atomic Design methodology ensures maintainable component architecture
- Rolling system uses proven gacha mechanics for engagement
- Real-time multiplayer requires careful state synchronization
- Mobile-first approach ensures broad accessibility
