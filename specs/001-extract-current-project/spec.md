## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Players engage in fast-paced 30 second to 2 minute gaming sessions where they collect meme-themed cards through randomized rolls with automated batch processing, craft powerful enhancement items through resource conversion, optimize deck configurations with detected synergy bonuses within evolving size limits, battle enemies in automated combat using emoji-based attacks with passive ability triggers, and progress through increasingly challenging stages with boss encounters. The game creates an addiction loop through sophisticated roll mechanics with multi-tiered pity systems, strategic deck building with synergy recommendations, crafting progression systems, and immediate combat gratification enhanced by passive effects.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new player starts the game, **When** they perform their first card roll using auto-roll controls, **Then** they receive guaranteed beginner cards and can immediately equip them with synergy detection feedback
2. **Given** a player has been rolling cards without getting rare drops, **When** they reach any pity system threshold (10/30/90/200), **Then** they are guaranteed to receive higher rarity cards with visual confirmation and pity counter reset
3. **Given** a player has collected sufficient resources, **When** they access the crafting panel, **Then** they can create consumable boosts, permanent upgrades, or special cards according to available recipes with cooldown management
4. **Given** a player has assembled their deck, **When** combat initiates, **Then** passive abilities trigger on battle start, synergy bonuses activate automatically, and emoji projectiles execute with effect processing
5. **Given** a player progresses through stages, **When** they complete boss encounters, **Then** they unlock higher deck size limits, access advanced crafting recipes, and face more challenging enemy compositions
6. **Given** a player equips cards with complementary attributes, **When** the system detects valid combinations, **Then** synergy bonuses automatically activate with real-time strength calculations and archetype classification
7. **Given** a player has active crafted items, **When** they engage in combat or rolling activities, **Then** temporary boosts apply automatically with usage tracking and expiration management
8. **Given** a player's cards trigger combat events, **When** passive ability conditions are met, **Then** effects activate according to chance percentages with cooldown enforcement and stat modifications

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player's deck is at maximum capacity and they try to equip additional cards?
- How does the system handle combat scenarios where both players/enemies have identical health remaining?
- What occurs if a player attempts to craft items without sufficient materials or during cooldown periods?
- How does the game respond when pity system guarantees conflict with available card pools?
- What happens when multiple passive abilities trigger simultaneously during combat?
- How are synergy conflicts resolved when cards qualify for multiple synergy types?
- What occurs when crafted temporary items expire during active combat encounters?
