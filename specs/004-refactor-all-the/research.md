# Research: Project Refactoring for Claude Code & Spec-Kit Optimization

**Feature**: Refactor project for AI-assisted development optimization  
**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Research Phase**: Complete  

## Research Summary

This research identifies best practices for optimizing a React TypeScript project for AI-assisted development using Claude Code and spec-kit workflows, with emphasis on agent collaboration and comprehensive testing.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Spec-Kit Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Implement numbered feature branches with comprehensive specification workflow  
**Rationale**: Provides structured approach for AI agents to understand and collaborate on features  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Simple feature branches without specs (rejected: lacks AI context)
- Monolithic documentation (rejected: difficult for agents to parse)

**Best Practices Identified**:
- Use XXX-feature-name pattern for branches and spec directories
- Maintain spec.md → plan.md → tasks.md workflow
- Include contracts/ directory for service interfaces
- Use absolute paths for Windows compatibility

### 2. Playwright Test Architecture for Agent Collaboration

**Decision**: Implement hierarchical test structure with agent-friendly naming and organization  
**Rationale**: Enables multiple AI agents to understand and contribute to test coverage systematically  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Flat test structure (rejected: difficult for agents to navigate)
- Component-co-located tests only (rejected: lacks system-level validation)

**Best Practices Identified**:
- Structure: tests/contract/, tests/integration/, tests/e2e/, tests/unit/
- Naming: Descriptive test names indicating purpose and scope
- Page Object Model for E2E tests to reduce maintenance
- Test data isolation using unique identifiers
- Real dependency usage over mocking for integration tests

### 3. Agent Communication Patterns

**Decision**: Implement standardized context files (CLAUDE.md, agent-specific instructions)  
**Rationale**: Each AI agent type has specific context requirements and optimal communication patterns  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single README approach (rejected: not optimized for AI parsing)
- Inline code comments only (rejected: insufficient context scope)

**Best Practices Identified**:
- CLAUDE.md for Claude Code with project status, architecture, commands
- Separate instruction files for other agents (GitHub Copilot, Gemini)
- Task tracking in standardized tasks.md format
- Service contracts in markdown for API understanding
- Clear section markers in code for AI navigation

### 4. Cross-Platform Script Solutions

**Decision**: Use bash scripts with Windows compatibility wrappers (.bat files)  
**Rationale**: Ensures spec-kit workflows work reliably across all development platforms  
**Alternatives considered**:
- PowerShell only (rejected: not cross-platform)
- Node.js scripts (rejected: adds dependency complexity)
- Platform-specific scripts (rejected: maintenance overhead)

**Best Practices Identified**:
- Primary scripts in bash for Unix compatibility
- .bat wrappers calling bash scripts for Windows
- Git Bash requirement documentation for Windows users
- Absolute path usage to avoid path resolution issues
- Error handling with clear, actionable messages

### 5. Documentation Synchronization Strategies

**Decision**: Single source of truth with automated sync mechanisms  
**Rationale**: Prevents documentation drift and ensures AI agents have consistent information  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual synchronization (rejected: error-prone)
- Multiple sources of truth (rejected: creates conflicts)

**Best Practices Identified**:
- CLAUDE.md as primary AI context, other docs derive from it
- Spec files as feature-specific source of truth
- Automated update scripts for cross-document consistency
- Version tracking in documentation headers
- Change detection and notification systems

### 6. Clean Architecture for AI Navigation

**Decision**: Implement atomic design pattern with clear service boundaries  
**Rationale**: AI agents can better understand and modify code when structure follows predictable patterns  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Feature-based organization (rejected: harder for AI to find related functionality)
- Flat structure (rejected: becomes unmanageable at scale)

**Best Practices Identified**:
- Atomic design: atoms → molecules → organisms → pages → templates
- Service layer separation with clear contracts
- Models unified in single location
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- Clear naming conventions for AI comprehension

### 7. Testing Strategy for Spec-Kit Workflows

**Decision**: TDD approach with contract-first testing integrated into spec-kit phases  
**Rationale**: Ensures quality while maintaining AI-friendly development workflow  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Implementation-first testing (rejected: conflicts with TDD principles)
- Manual testing only (rejected: not scalable or reliable)

**Best Practices Identified**:
- Phase sequence: Contract tests → Integration tests → E2E tests → Unit tests
- Real dependency usage in integration tests
- Test data factories for consistent test scenarios
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Accessibility testing integration

### 8. Performance Optimization for AI Workflows

**Decision**: Implement caching and incremental processing for large codebases  
**Rationale**: Enables AI agents to work efficiently even as project grows  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Full reprocessing each time (rejected: too slow)
- No optimization (rejected: becomes bottleneck)

**Best Practices Identified**:
- Incremental spec processing
- Caching of AI context generation
- Lazy loading of large documentation sections
- Optimized file watching for development
- Memory-efficient parsing strategies

## Technology Choices Validated

- **AI Benefits**: Clear test descriptions, good error messages, agent-friendly syntax

### Build Tool: Vite
- **Rationale**: Fast development server, modern module handling, plugin ecosystem
- **AI Benefits**: Clear configuration, predictable build process, excellent debugging

### Documentation: Markdown + YAML frontmatter
- **Rationale**: Universal format, easy parsing, version control friendly
- **AI Benefits**: Standard format across tools, easy to generate and update

## Integration Patterns Researched

### 1. CI/CD Integration
- Automated spec validation on PR creation
- Test execution in spec-kit workflow phases
- Documentation generation and sync

### 2. IDE Integration

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Migration Risk
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during refactoring
- **Mitigation**: Parallel implementation with feature flags, comprehensive test coverage

### 2. Adoption Risk
- **Risk**: Team resistance to new workflows
- **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout, clear documentation, benefits demonstration

### 3. Maintenance Risk
- **Risk**: Additional complexity requiring ongoing maintenance
- **Mitigation**: Automation of sync processes, clear ownership model, regular review cycles
