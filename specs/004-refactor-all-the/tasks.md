## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 2: Contract Tests (T006-T009)
```bash
# Launch all contract tests together:
Task: "Contract test for SpecService interface in tests/contract/SpecService.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for TestOrchestrationService interface in tests/contract/TestOrchestrationService.test.ts" 
Task: "Contract test for AgentContextService interface in tests/contract/AgentContextService.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for DocumentationSyncService interface in tests/contract/DocumentationSyncService.test.ts"
```

### Phase 3: Data Models (T010-T018)
```bash
# Launch all model creation together:
Task: "SpecificationDocument model in src/models/SpecificationDocument.ts"
Task: "ImplementationPlan model in src/models/ImplementationPlan.ts"
Task: "TaskList model in src/models/TaskList.ts"
Task: "Task model in src/models/Task.ts"
Task: "ServiceContract model in src/models/ServiceContract.ts"
# ... (continue with all 9 models)
```

### Phase 5: Integration Tests (T023-T030)
```bash
# Launch integration tests together:
Task: "Integration test for specification lifecycle in tests/integration/specification-lifecycle.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for task generation workflow in tests/integration/task-generation.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for agent context sync in tests/integration/agent-context-sync.test.ts"
# ... (continue with all integration tests)
```

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different files, no shared dependencies
- **TDD CRITICAL**: All contract tests must fail before implementing services
- **Refactoring focus**: Preserve existing game functionality while optimizing structure
- **Cross-platform**: All script fixes must work on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- **AI optimization**: Structure must enable Claude Code to understand project in <30 seconds

## Task Generation Rules Applied
*Completed during execution*

✅ **From Contracts**: 4 contract files → 4 contract test tasks [P]
✅ **From Data Model**: 9 entities → 9 model creation tasks [P]  
✅ **From Research**: Cross-platform scripts → Windows compatibility tasks
✅ **From Quickstart**: Test scenarios → Integration and E2E tests [P]
✅ **Ordering**: Setup → Contract Tests → Models → Services → Integration → Polish
✅ **Dependencies**: Models before services, tests before implementation

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: All items must be checked*

- [x] All 4 contracts have corresponding contract tests (T006-T009)
- [x] All 9 entities have model creation tasks (T010-T018)  
- [x] All contract tests come before service implementation (T006-T009 → T019-T022)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files, no dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path and deliverable
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD workflow enforced: failing tests → implementation → passing tests
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility addressed (T031-T034)
- [x] AI optimization requirements covered (T039-T040)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ 40 executable tasks generated from design documents
- ✅ Constitutional TDD order: Contract → Integration → E2E → Unit
- ✅ Parallel execution maximized: 18 tasks marked [P]
- ✅ Clear dependencies preventing conflicts
- ✅ All functional requirements from spec.md addressed
- ✅ Cross-platform script compatibility ensured
- ✅ AI navigation optimization included
- ✅ Atomic design pattern reorganization planned
