## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using Claude Code, I want the project structure and documentation to be optimized for AI-assisted development, so that Claude can understand the codebase quickly, make accurate modifications, and follow established patterns consistently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer opens the project with Claude Code, **When** they ask about project structure, **Then** Claude can immediately understand the architecture from CLAUDE.md and spec files
2. **Given** a developer needs to implement a new feature, **When** they use the /specify command, **Then** the spec-kit workflow guides them through specification, planning, and implementation phases
3. **Given** Claude needs to modify existing code, **When** it reads project files, **Then** it can quickly locate relevant components using clear naming and organization
4. **Given** a developer runs tests, **When** they use npm commands, **Then** all test scripts work reliably and provide clear feedback
5. **Given** Claude needs context about current work, **When** it reads task files, **Then** it understands exactly what phase the project is in

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple spec branches exist simultaneously?
- How does system handle conflicting documentation between CLAUDE.md and spec files?
- What occurs when spec-kit scripts fail on Windows vs Unix systems?
- How does Claude handle incomplete or malformed spec files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Documentation & Context Management**
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain a single source of truth in CLAUDE.md for AI context
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide clear project status visibility through STATUS.md
- **FR-003**: Each feature MUST have numbered spec directories following XXX-feature-name pattern
- **FR-004**: Specs MUST follow consistent template structure for AI parsing
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST be automatically synchronized across all relevant files

**Project Structure & Organization**
- **FR-006**: File structure MUST follow atomic design pattern consistently
- **FR-007**: All services MUST have clear contracts in spec directories
- **FR-008**: Test files MUST be co-located or clearly mapped to source files
- **FR-009**: Data models MUST be unified and centrally defined
- **FR-010**: Component dependencies MUST be explicit and minimal

**Development Workflow**
- **FR-011**: Spec-kit scripts MUST work reliably on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- **FR-012**: Feature branches MUST follow numbered naming convention
- **FR-013**: Each development phase MUST have clear entry/exit criteria
- **FR-014**: Task tracking MUST use standardized format in tasks.md files
- **FR-015**: Git commits MUST follow conventional commit format

**AI Optimization**
- **FR-016**: Code MUST include clear section markers for AI navigation
- **FR-017**: Functions MUST have descriptive names indicating their purpose
- **FR-018**: Complex logic MUST be documented with inline explanations
- **FR-019**: File paths in documentation MUST be absolute for Windows compatibility
- **FR-020**: Error messages MUST be descriptive and actionable

**Testing & Validation**
- **FR-021**: Unit tests MUST cover all critical business logic
- **FR-022**: E2E tests MUST validate complete user workflows
- **FR-023**: Test commands MUST be documented and consistent
- **FR-024**: Test data MUST be isolated and reproducible
- **FR-025**: Performance benchmarks MUST be measurable

**Build & Deployment**
- **FR-026**: Build process MUST be deterministic and reproducible
- **FR-027**: Development environment MUST be quickly spinnable with single command
- **FR-028**: Dependencies MUST be clearly documented with versions
- **FR-029**: Configuration MUST be environment-specific and secure
- **FR-030**: Build artifacts MUST be gitignored appropriately

### Key Entities

- **Specification System**: Central mechanism for defining features with templates, workflows, and validation
- **Documentation Hub**: CLAUDE.md as primary AI context, STATUS.md for quick status, README.md for users
- **Task Management**: Numbered tasks with dependencies, phases, and parallel execution markers
- **Test Framework**: Comprehensive unit and E2E tests with clear naming and purpose
- **Development Scripts**: Cross-platform utilities for common workflows (feature creation, planning, testing)

## Additional Context

### Current Pain Points
- Inconsistent file organization making it difficult for AI to navigate
- Multiple conflicting model definitions (unified vs standard)
- Incomplete or outdated documentation
- Windows-specific path issues in scripts
- Lack of clear development workflow documentation

### Success Metrics
- Claude Code can understand project structure in < 30 seconds
- New features can be specified and implemented following clear workflow
- Tests run reliably across all platforms
- Documentation stays synchronized automatically
- Development velocity increases by 50%

### Out of Scope
- Changing core game functionality
- Migrating to different technology stack
- Implementing new game features
- Performance optimization of game engine
- UI/UX redesign
