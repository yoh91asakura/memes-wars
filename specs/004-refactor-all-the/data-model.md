## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Specification to Implementation Flow
```
SpecificationDocument → ImplementationPlan → TaskList → Task → TestCase
```

### 2. Agent Collaboration Flow
```
AgentContext ← SpecificationDocument → TaskList → Task → Implementation
```

### 3. Documentation Sync Flow
```
SpecificationDocument → DocumentationSync → AgentContext → DerivedDocs
```

### 4. Testing Workflow
```
ServiceContract → ContractTest → IntegrationTest → E2ETest → Implementation
```

## State Transitions

### SpecificationDocument States
- `draft` → `approved` (via review process)
- `approved` → `in-progress` (via /plan command)
- `in-progress` → `completed` (via implementation finish)

### Task States
- `pending` → `in-progress` (via task start)
- `in-progress` → `completed` (via task finish)
- `in-progress` → `blocked` (via dependency issue)
- `blocked` → `in-progress` (via dependency resolution)

### TestCase States
- `not-written` → `failing` (via TDD test creation)
- `failing` → `passing` (via implementation)
- `passing` → `failing` (via regression)

## Validation Constraints

### Cross-Entity Validation
- ImplementationPlan cannot exist without approved SpecificationDocument
- TaskList cannot be generated without completed ImplementationPlan Phase 1
- Tasks cannot be started without prerequisite tasks completed
- Tests must be written before implementation (TDD enforcement)

### Data Integrity Rules
- All file paths must be absolute and accessible
- Specification IDs must be unique across project
- Task dependencies must not create cycles
- Service contracts must have corresponding test files

### Performance Constraints
- AgentContext files must remain under 150 lines for token efficiency
- Documentation sync must complete within 30 seconds
- Test execution feedback must be available within 2 minutes
- File operations must handle large codebases efficiently

## Future Extensions

### Planned Enhancements
- Integration with external project management tools
- Real-time collaboration features for multiple agents
- Automated conflict resolution in documentation sync
- Performance analytics and optimization suggestions
- Template customization for different project types

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling for large codebases
- Efficient storage and retrieval of historical data
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed information
- Incremental processing for large specification changes
