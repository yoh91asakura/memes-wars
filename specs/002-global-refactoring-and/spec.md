## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úì COMPLETE: Multiple game system issues identified requiring comprehensive refactoring
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úì COMPLETE: Identified broken card display, navigation issues, architecture problems
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úì COMPLETE: All major problem areas documented and analyzed
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úì COMPLETE: Developer and player scenarios for stable game experience
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úì COMPLETE: Comprehensive system stability and spec documentation requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úì COMPLETE: Game systems, specs, navigation, persistence entities defined
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úì COMPLETE: Focus on maintainability and developer experience
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Developers working on Memes Wars encounter multiple system failures including broken card display, non-functional navigation between game sections, inconsistent data models, and accumulated technical debt. They need a comprehensive refactoring approach with detailed specifications for each game system to ensure consistent development, testing, and maintenance. Players should experience seamless navigation between game sections, reliable card display with stats (HP, Luck, emojis), and persistent game state between sessions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer accesses any game page via URL, **When** they navigate to `/collection`, **Then** the CollectionPage renders correctly and displays cards with HP/Luck/emojis
2. **Given** a player has cards in their collection, **When** they navigate between Roll/Collection/Combat pages, **Then** all navigation works correctly and data persists
3. **Given** a developer works on any game system, **When** they need to understand requirements, **Then** detailed specs exist for card system, collection, combat, rolls, UI navigation, and data persistence
4. **Given** a player starts the game for the first time, **When** they begin playing, **Then** they receive starter cards and can immediately see them in their collection
5. **Given** a developer runs tests, **When** they execute the test suite, **Then** all critical game functions pass without Navigation/React/Display errors

### Edge Cases
- What happens when collection is empty but page should show cards?
- How does system handle URL navigation without React Router?
- What happens when card models conflict between different parts of codebase?
- How does system recover from display CSS issues hiding card content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Game MUST provide working URL-based navigation between all sections (Roll, Collection, Combat, Craft, Deck)
- **FR-002**: Collection page MUST display cards correctly with visible HP, Luck stats and emoji inventory
- **FR-003**: Game MUST provide starter cards to new players on first load
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist player data (cards, currency, progress) between browser sessions
- **FR-005**: Development team MUST have detailed specifications for each game system module
- **FR-006**: Card display system MUST use consistent data models across all components
- **FR-007**: Navigation system MUST sync URL changes with application state
- **FR-008**: Testing framework MUST validate all critical game flows without errors
- **FR-009**: Game MUST load and display initial interface within 3 seconds
- **FR-010**: All game systems MUST be documented with clear functional requirements

### System Architecture Requirements
- **SA-001**: Each major game system MUST have separate specification document
- **SA-002**: Code MUST separate test utilities from production components
- **SA-003**: Card models MUST be unified across all game systems
- **SA-004**: CSS positioning MUST not hide or overlay critical game content
- **SA-005**: Development workflow MUST include automated testing for navigation and display

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Game System Specs**: Detailed requirements documents for Card System, Collection System, Combat Engine, Roll/Gacha System, UI Navigation, Data Persistence
- **Card Entity**: Unified data model with HP, Luck, emoji effects, rarity, and display properties
- **Navigation State**: URL routing synchronized with application page state
- **Persistence Layer**: Browser-based storage for player progress, cards, and game settings
- **Test Coverage**: Automated validation for display issues, navigation problems, and data consistency

## Implementation Plan Summary

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (Immediate)
1. Fix URL navigation with React Router
2. Resolve CollectionPage display issues  
3. Provide starter cards to new players
4. Unify Card data models

### Phase 2: Spec Documentation (Short-term)  
1. Create detailed specs for each game system
2. Document all functional requirements
3. Establish testing standards
4. Clean up test/production code separation

### Phase 3: Architectural Improvements (Medium-term)
1. Implement persistent data storage
2. Optimize performance and rendering
3. Enhance error handling and recovery
4. Establish maintainable development workflow

**Success Metric**: Player can navigate all game sections, see cards correctly, and development team has complete specifications for ongoing work.
