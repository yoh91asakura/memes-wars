**Feature Branch**: `005-complete-card-management`  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "je veux que la gestion des cartes soit complete dans le projet, affichage, filtre, utilisation du backend, possibilit√© de mettre un png comme illustration.."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Complete card management system with display, filtering, backend integration, custom PNG illustrations
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Players managing their card collections
   ‚Üí Actions: View, filter, search, upload custom images, sync with backend
   ‚Üí Data: Card collections, filters, custom images, metadata
   ‚Üí Constraints: PNG format for images, backend synchronization required
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Image storage location and size limits marked for clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Complete player workflows for card management defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 12 functional requirements covering all aspects of card management
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Card, CardCollection, CardFilter, CardImage, BackendSync entities defined
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player of Memes Wars, I want to have complete control over my card collection so that I can easily find the cards I need, customize their appearance with personal images, and ensure my collection is always synchronized across devices through backend integration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a collection of 200+ cards, **When** I open the card management interface, **Then** I see all my cards displayed in a paginated view with clear visual indicators for rarity and type
2. **Given** I want to find specific cards, **When** I use the filtering system, **Then** I can filter by rarity, type, cost, abilities, and see results update in real-time
3. **Given** I want to personalize my favorite card, **When** I upload a PNG image, **Then** the card displays with my custom illustration while preserving game mechanics
4. **Given** I make changes to my collection, **When** I switch devices, **Then** all my filters, custom images, and collection data are synchronized through the backend
5. **Given** I have many cards, **When** I search for a specific card name or ability, **Then** the system quickly finds and highlights matching cards

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploading an oversized PNG image?
- How does the system handle network disconnection during backend sync?
- What occurs when filtering results in zero matches?
- How are custom images handled when the original card is updated?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all cards in the player's collection with pagination support for collections over 50 cards
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide multi-criteria filtering including rarity, type, cost range, abilities, and custom tags
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow real-time text search across card names, descriptions, and abilities
- **FR-004**: System MUST support sorting by name, rarity, cost, acquisition date, and custom priority
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow players to upload PNG images as custom card illustrations
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate uploaded images for format (PNG only), file size [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file size limit], and dimensions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum/maximum dimensions]
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve original card data and mechanics when displaying custom illustrations
- **FR-008**: System MUST synchronize all collection data, filters, and custom images with backend storage
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle offline mode gracefully, queuing changes for sync when connection is restored
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide visual feedback for sync status (syncing, synced, failed, offline)
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow players to preview cards with original and custom illustrations side-by-side
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain filter preferences and search history across sessions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Card**: Game card with stats, abilities, rarity, original illustration, and optional custom illustration
- **CardCollection**: Player's complete set of cards with metadata like acquisition date, usage statistics
- **CardFilter**: Filter criteria including rarity selection, cost ranges, type categories, text search terms
- **CardImage**: Custom PNG illustration with validation metadata, original filename, upload timestamp
- **BackendSync**: Synchronization status and data consistency management between client and server
